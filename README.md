# MACHINE-LEARNING(Trouble Free)
# DAY-1
EP-1 - Field of study that gives computer a capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
        AI>>>ML>>>DL
EP-2 - Well Posed Learning i.e (An agent solves a problem or task T with performance P and gain some experience E.
       also called learning by experience)
EP-3 - Perspective of ML involves searching very large space of possible hypothesis(idea) and to determine one that best fits the observed data and any prior knowledge held by learner.
       Some issues in ML :- what algo to be used, how much training and testing data , what kinds of methods 
Ep-4 - Designing a learning system:- 4 steps 
      1. choosing the training experience.
      2. choosing the target function.
      3. choosing a representation for target function.
      4. choosing a learning algo for approximating the target function.
